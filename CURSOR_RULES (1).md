  The app will connect to external APIs for Google Maps, social media platforms, and payment gateways.

- **Testing expectations?**
  Testing expectations include unit tests for components, integration tests for the app's main features, and end-to-end tests for the entire application.

  Security guidelines focus on ensuring the app does not collect or store any sensitive user data, adhering to best practices for secure authentication and authorization.

- **Performance considerations?**
  Performance considerations include optimizing image sizes, using efficient React components, and ensuring fast page loads.
